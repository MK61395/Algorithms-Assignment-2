# Algorithms Assignment Comparative Analysis

This repository contains the files related to the Algorithms Assignment Comparative Analysis conducted by a group of four members. The assignment involved implementing and testing four different sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort. The comparative analysis was performed using Excel sheets with graphs to evaluate the performance of each algorithm.

## Files

1. `SelectionSort.cpp`: C++ code implementing the Selection Sort algorithm.
2. `student_data.csv`: CSV file containing sample student data used for testing the algorithms.
3. `SortedData.csv`: CSV file containing sorted data generated by the algorithms.
4. `Selection_Running_Time.csv`: CSV file containing running time data for the Selection Sort algorithm.
5. `compare.xlsx`: Excel sheet containing the comparative analysis and graphs.
6. `DataGeneration.cpp`: C++ code for generating sample data.
7. `PDF Document`: Document containing detailed analysis and conclusions.

## Analysis

The analysis conducted includes:

- Time complexity comparison for different input sizes.
- Space complexity comparison.
- Stability analysis for each sorting algorithm.
- Graphical representation of algorithm performance.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
Clone the repository to your local machine:
Compile and run the SelectionSort.cpp file to observe the sorting results and generate running time data.

Use the provided sample data (student_data.csv) or generate your own data using DataGeneration.cpp.



Open the compare.xlsx file to view the detailed comparative analysis and graphs.
