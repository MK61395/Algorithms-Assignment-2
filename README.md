Comparative Analysis
This repository contains the files related to the Algorithms Assignment Comparative Analysis conducted by a group of four members. The assignment involved implementing and testing four different sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort. The comparative analysis was performed using Excel sheets with graphs to evaluate the performance of each algorithm.
