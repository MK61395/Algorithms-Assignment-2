Algorithms Assignment Comparative Analysis
This repository contains the files related to the Algorithms Assignment Comparative Analysis conducted by a group of four members. The assignment involved implementing and testing four different sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort. The comparative analysis was performed using Excel sheets with graphs to evaluate the performance of each algorithm.

Files
SelectionSort.cpp: C++ code implementing the Selection Sort algorithm.
student_data.csv: CSV file containing sample student data used for testing the algorithms.
SortedData.csv: CSV file containing sorted data generated by the algorithms.
Selection_Running_Time.csv: CSV file containing running time data for the Selection Sort algorithm.
compare.xlsx: Excel sheet containing the comparative analysis and graphs.
DataGeneration.cpp: C++ code for generating sample data.
PDF Document: Document containing detailed analysis and conclusions.
Analysis
The analysis conducted includes:

Time complexity comparison for different input sizes.
Space complexity comparison.
Stability analysis for each sorting algorithm.
Graphical representation of algorithm performance.
